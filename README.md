# Web-Development
This is the GitHub Repo for the Web Development module.

# Git Usage
We will have 3 types of branches
1. The main branch will receive the final changes.
2. The dev branched will be used to store changes towards the final product.
3. A branch for every issue that is used to implement features.

For every feature there will be an Issue that will be used to create the branches. Once the issue has been fully implemented the branch will be merged to the dev branch.
At the end when every feature has been implemented and the project is "finished" the dev branched will be merged to the main branch.
